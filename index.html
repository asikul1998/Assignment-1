             <p> 
                 Due to heavy rainfall in the Indian states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, the flood waters of Surma, Kushiyara and other rivers overflowed, causing severe flooding in Greater.
                 In the last few weeks, millions of people in the Sylhet and Sunamganj districts have experienced heavy rains and flash floods, leaving them homeless and without possessions.
            
                 Water has also entered different areas of Sunamganj municipal town. Due to the flooding, many educational institutions have closed in the district.

                    Here we have a team working on relief assistance. Some boats are needed on an emergency basis as relief is becoming increasingly difficult to reach in remote areas.

                The donations will be split and distributed in different ways, please state on your donation if you want it to go to a specific area (detailed below) or if it is Zakat money (I am having that distributed separately).

                My Maternal uncle who lives in Bishwanath Sylhet is in his late 60s and said he had never seen the likes of this flood in his life, the situation is much worse than he has ever seen before.
